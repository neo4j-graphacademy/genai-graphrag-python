Neo4j is a graph database that stores data in a graph structure.
Data is stored as nodes and relationships instead of tables or documents.
Graph databases are particularly useful when _the connections between data are as important as the data itself_.
A graph shows how objects are related to each other.
The objects are referred to as *nodes* (vertices) connected by *relationships* (edges).
Neo4j uses the graph structure to store data and is known as a *labeled property graph*.
